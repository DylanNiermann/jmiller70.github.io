  2014 was one of the most incredible year's of my life.  Having worked at DxR
Development Group for 13 years and 9 Months in the role of Manager of Technical
Support- I finally grew tired of the atmosphere and decided to explore other IT
opportunities. I began applying at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale
for various technical positions. I felt like it would take years to get on, but
my sister  encouraged me to pursue something better.  At first I failed to get
an interview for one Assistant Manager position within Central IT. But I kept
trying, determined to find a job that I would enjoy.  Finally, a really  great
opportunity opened up that would turn out to be the job that I hope to keep
until I retire.  I am now part of the University Housing IT Department at
Southern Illinois University-Carbondale.  Actually I am the IT Director for
University Housing at SIU-C, with a functional title of Assistant Director-IT.
