  2014 was one of the most incredible year's of my life.  Having worked at DxR
Development Group for 13 years and 9 Months in the role of Manager of Technical
Support- I finally grew tired of the atmosphere and decided to explore other IT
opportunities. I began applied at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale
for various technical positions. I felt like it would take years to get on, but
my sister  encouraged me to continue to pursue something better.  I ended up
testing for a few positions and 1 month went by. Then, a really  great opportunity
