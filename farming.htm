This is my mom on Mothers day 2018. After having a family lunch at Applebees, we began planting sweet potatoes around 5PM. The device we were using is called a transplanter.

After a great deal of prep-work; including starting plants, plowing, tilling, and creating hills, we were able to start a 100-day growing cycle that would end with storing hundreds of bushels of sweet potatoes in our barn for the winter. You might think that this is a lot of work, and I would tend to agree with you.


This is an arial view of the front 40 acres of our farm, provided by google maps.

Growing up in Southern Illinois, I was exposed to farming and gardening of all different types. 

I definitely grew up in an atmosphere where we grew a great deal of the food we ate. This is most likely because of the past generations of my family having to do this out of necessity. 

My 4th great grandfather relocated his family from Ohio to the Southern Illinois area around 1850. They were able to purchase large tracks of land at a very cheap price, right next door to what we know as Southern Illinois Universities very own “Touch of Nature”. 

These people grew their own food and sold off other crops to the marketplace. I actually have little knowledge of what their major crops were and which ones they relied upon for a personal food supply. 

From reading letters passed down through the generations, I have gleaned that they grew wheat, corn, beats and cabbage and other vegetables that they could preserve. I really don’t know if they grew many sweet potatoes. 

As it turns out, my Grandfather who passed away in 1991 figured out that one of the easiest crops to grow in Southern Illinois is actually the sweet potato. 

They actually grow very well around here and starting with him, it became our number one crop. Of course we also grow tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, squash, cabbage, beats, beans, and many other vegetables and fruits, but we have come to rely on sweet potatoes as our main crop. 

Since my father retired in 2006, he has slowly started to grow mostly sweet potatoes because of his involvement in the local farmer’s markets. 

At 73 years of age, he is one of the hardest working individuals you will ever meet. There really isn’t much on the farm that he hasn’t done. 

By concentrating mainly on the sweet potatoes, he can raise the quality of our potatoes and simply trade them for whatever he wants at the marketplace.
