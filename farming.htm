The video above is my mom and son planting sweet potatoes. The device we were using is called a transplanter.

After a great deal of prep-work; including starting plants, plowing, tilling, and creating hills, we were able to start a 100-day growing cycle that would end with storing hundreds of bushels of sweet potatoes in our barn for the winter. You might think that this is a lot of work, and I would tend to agree with you.

Sweet Potatoes can be started from sweet potatoes. In the movie “The Martian” when you saw Matt Damon’s character start a crop of potatoes from his existing potatoes; that is actually very close to the way we begin our process.
