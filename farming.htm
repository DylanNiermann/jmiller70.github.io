            <h1>Sweet Potatoes</h1>
            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p class ="first">

This is my mom and son on Mothers day 2018. After having a family lunch at Applebees, we began planting sweet potatoes around 5PM. The device we were using is called a transplanter.

After a great deal of prep-work; including starting plants, plowing, tilling, and creating hills, we were able to start a 100-day growing cycle that would end with storing hundreds of bushels of sweet potatoes in our barn for the winter. You might think that this is a lot of work, and I would tend to agree with you.
</p>
<p>
This is an arial view of the front 40 acres of our farm, provided by google maps.

Growing up in Southern Illinois, I was exposed to farming and gardening of all different types. 

I definitely grew up in an atmosphere where we grew a great deal of the food we ate. This is most likely because of the past generations of my family having to do this out of necessity. 

My 4th great grandfather relocated his family from Ohio to the Southern Illinois area around 1850. They were able to purchase large tracks of land at a very cheap price, right next door to what we know as Southern Illinois Universities very own “Touch of Nature”. 

These people grew their own food and sold off other crops to the marketplace. I actually have little knowledge of what their major crops were and which ones they relied upon for a personal food supply. 

From reading letters passed down through the generations, I have gleaned that they grew wheat, corn, beats and cabbage and other vegetables that they could preserve. I really don’t know if they grew many sweet potatoes. 
</p>
<p>
As it turns out, my Grandfather who passed away in 1991 figured out that one of the easiest crops to grow in Southern Illinois is actually the sweet potato. 

They actually grow very well around here and starting with him, it became our number one crop. Of course we also grow tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, squash, cabbage, beats, beans, and many other vegetables and fruits, but we have come to rely on sweet potatoes as our main crop. 

Since my father retired in 2006, he has slowly started to grow mostly sweet potatoes because of his involvement in the local farmer’s markets. 

At 73 years of age, he is one of the hardest working individuals you will ever meet. There really isn’t much on the farm that he hasn’t done. 

By concentrating mainly on the sweet potatoes, he can raise the quality of our potatoes and simply trade them for whatever he wants at the marketplace. 
</p>
            <h2>The Start</h2>
            <p class ="first">
Sweet Potatoes can be started from sweet potatoes. In the movie “The Martian” when you saw Matt Damon’s character start a crop of potatoes from his existing potatoes; that is actually very close to the way we begin our process.

I will give you a tour of our process, which involves the following steps of planting, weeding, fertilizing, harvesting, storage methods, and ending with the best part, eating.  We start from a 10” sand bed, covered with a plastic cap, each bed sometimes having different varieties of sweet potatoes. 

We usually plant several thousand “slips” each year, yielding several hundred bushel of potatoes. We begin the process by late April or May, when the weather is hot enough to keep the temperature in the beds at 85 degrees. 

The air temperature inside our “greenhouse” can often reach 100 degrees. As my father says, the hotter the better, in order to keep the temperature of the soil warm enough through the nights, when ambient temperatures can dip into the 40’s. 

The potatoes, saved from the previous year, are buried whole in the sand beds. They are spaced apart 5-6 inches, but the spacing is not all that critical. As you can see, when the slips begin to produce it is a beautiful sight!

In a few weeks the slip’s reach about 12”-15” and have a good exposed root system. Each potato can produce many tightly bunched slips, the entire bed will be covered when they are ready. 

They are then pulled, separated, and placed into a container half-full of water to stay hydrated. Some of the slips are then sold or traded to other local farmers. 

The rest are planted in the fields on our farm, just a bout a mile from where my 4th great grandfather’s farm was actually located. 

The machine we use in the intro video is a PTO, or “power take off” device that turns a revolving apparatus that places each slip into the soil at the desired depth. 

As you can imagine this machine requires careful calibration and needs constant attention to assure it is working correctly. 

It is our preferred method of planting and simply takes a fraction of the time it would take to plant them all by hand.

The transplanter has two seats and requires two people to operate in its full capacity. We can plant a 100 foot row in minutes, that would take hours to do by hand methods. 



Aside from starting the slips, there is a great deal of prep-work involved in getting the soil ready for planting. 

We till the soil and create rows that are actual “hills” to raise the level of the plant. The spacing is determined by the width of your tractor tires and size of tractor. This makes them easier to harvest and makes a path for the tractor tire, as we rely on the tractor being able to navigate the rows in order to plant, water and harvest. 

After creating the hills, we usually hydrate the soil so that new plants will have plenty of moisture to begin their growth cycle. Depending on rain and weather conditions, we will water as required for the next few weeks as the young plants grow. 

Eventually they will be able to get most of the water they need from rain. When conditions are dry, we pump water through thousands of feet of hoses from one of our nearby ponds. 

The hills also work to create a trench that contains the water nicely, without being too close to the plant itself. 

Too much moisture can be detrimental, so the hill keeps the water at a safe distance so we will not have issues with mildew and plant rot. 

A nearby 7-acre pond on the property provides virtually all of the water we could ever need, and we also have several smaller ponds to help out. Using a large tank on the front of a tractor, we can also directly water the new plant when they are small.

            <h2>Harvesting</h2>
            <p class ="first">
When beginning the harvest, we try to wait for a day when the soil has a bit of moisture and that is usually not a problem in September. The more rain we get around September, the more prone everything will be to start rotting in the ground due to excessive heat and moisture. 

When the plants are mature, the lush green foliage is simply mowed off. Comparing some of these photos you can see that it must be stripped away in order to plow up the row and harvest the potatoes. A large grasshopper mower or a bush-hog is used for this task.


After we mow and remove the foliage for the area, we plow up the row with a special single hook plow. 

The plow goes underneath the hill and churns up everything without excessive damage to the potatoes. 

This demonstrates the structure of the plant and root system, which is a actually a thick root, or the potato itself. This a textbook example of “Beauregard’s”, one of the larger, consistent varieties that are a favorite at the markets.’
            
The potatoes are very fragile when they first come out of the soil. The skin has not cured and is very easy to damage. Gloves are required to pick them up and extreme care is used to ensure a quality product. 

Although there are machines that can actually pick up the potatoes, we do not use them. We usually hire 2-3 farm hands to help pick them up. 

They are picked up and placed in 5-gallon buckets, then transferred to a large bin on the front of a tractor. The bins are large wooden crates that have ventilation holes to help the potatoes to dry out. They will be very moist and warm when they come out of the ground. 

We pick up all that we can that are of the correct size. This actually means that we leave many potatoes there if they are too small. It seems incredible that we do this, but they become fertilizer if they are only an inch or less in circumference. 

Sometimes we let whoever is helping take home as many as they want, there are simply thousands left in the field for the deer and wildlife to eat.

The potatoes are sometimes very dirty and depending on how much moisture is in the ground, it can be quite messy! However that film of dirt is very protective later on and helps to seal the potato from humidity. They are left dirty for months.

Here, our farm hands are getting some the best exercise you can get. If you  take up this trade, you had better be ready to bend over and work. 4 of us can pick up a dozen of these crates full each day. we start at 7AM, and we usually quit at 12-noon each day. We only take one break around 9AM.
This is my 15 year old son, Drew. He is totally obsessed with technology, cell phones, and data, etc. He is getting an opportunity that most young people do not get.

I love the fact that he gets outside and participates in all phases of production.


He actually gets paid very well for a 15 year old, receiving $10 per hour for his work on the farm, including picking up the potatoes.

One last look at a beautiful patch nearing harvest time. This was the patch we planted on mothers day, only a few weeks from harvest.
            <h2>Storage</h2>
            <p class ="first">

In the end they are placed in a climate-controlled storage barn for the winter. It is ideal to keep them around 60 degrees. 

All heat is provided by a large wood burning stove in the insulated barn, and all the wood used to generate heat comes from our farm as well. Harvesting wood takes place year-round and for the most part, comes from fallen trees. 


The potatoes sit in the barn and as the orders from various accounts come in, they are washed and dried a few days ahead of delivery. 

We only wash and dry the amount we can deliver each week, and by the end of September, the orders start flowing in. 

Our potatoes wind up in St. Louis, Chicago, and many far-away places. We have many local distributers buy our potatoes and sell them through the winter. 

Universities, churches, hospitals, individuals and various merchants take the vast majority of our product. Through the summer and fall we eat very well, and we can usually get anything we want in return from the local farming community. 

We get bushels of apples, boxes of sweet corn, eggs, and literally just about anything of that nature that we would want in return for our product. 

Our product will store for 6-8 months and even longer with proper care, that means we pretty much have it year-round. This would be very hard and costly to accomplish with any other variety of produce. 

Our system is very sustainable and requires less special equipment. Our work with the potatoes is recognized each year by a few universities.

For a retired union mason, his work is very scientific in nature and he has collaborated with multiple scientists to perfect his system. 

In the early years, he consulted and started varieties received from the University of Georgia, including Beauregard’s and Bayou Belles. 

SIU also provides an opportunity to work with their agriculture department and the instructors there bring students out every year to observe and also to dig potatoes sometimes.

     
            <h2>What Else?</h2>
            <p class ="first">
                
As you can see, sweet potatoes are a very lucrative crop that you can grow and use year-round. 

In Asian culture they are used to produce shochu, a form of alcoholic beverage. Shochu is comparable to wine and sake, except the alcohol content is greater due to the amount of sugar in the sweet potatoes, and distillation methods used for production. 

Sweet potatoes are used not only for human consumption, but are gaining popularity as a dog treat when dehydrated. They are known to very kind to the dog’s digestive track and are very good for dogs that have allergies. The consistency of a dehydrated sweet potato provides a good experience for the dog in regard to chewing. 

When consumed by humans, sweet potatoes are regarded as a super-food containing a vast amount of nutrients. They are versatile due to the fact that you can cook them in many different types of ways, including frying, baking, boiling, etc. 


Our family has definitely benefitted from our collaboration on our sweet potatoes. Although I am involved in technology and work at SIU in IT leadership, almost everyone is more interested in our sweet potato production, pics, and videos when I post them on social media. 

Just looking at the 2018 harvest in the barn picture, it is difficult to even estimate how many pounds we produced.

This year’s crop of 2018 proved to be one of the two largest in the history of our production. Conditions were ideal, and this is one of the first years we started pulling out weeds by hand during the first months of the grow cycle. It really helped the production, but was a lot of hard work.

The idea of being self reliant, while working within a community to achieve a sustainable lifestyle is something we are very proud of.

I hope this presentation serves as an example of what you can achieve on just a few extra acres of land. It actually doesn’t take that much space to grow all of the potatoes you would need to survive on each year. 

You actually don’t need a large tract of land or fancy tractors and barns either. You could accomplish a great deal just having a tiller, and a few acres of land at the most. Hard work and ingenuity are required though, and the desire to learn and grow as a family also helps.
